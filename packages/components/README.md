# LabKey Components (@labkey/components)

This package contains Components, models, actions, and utility functions for LabKey applications and pages.

:construction: **Warning** :construction:
This package is under development, so these components should be considered unstable and are very likely to change.
Once they're ready, we'll officially push the components as version 1.0.0.

## Release Notes
Release notes for this package are available [here](releaseNotes/labkey/components.md).

## Development

### Getting Started
If you are building the components locally, you will need to do the following to prepare your system.

#### 1. Install yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is a package manager much like npm.
There a couple of different ways to install yarn. If you have npm you can do a global install:

```sh
npm install yarn -g
```

If you are working on a Mac and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can install using:

```sh
brew install yarn
```

Yarn should now be available on the command line.

#### 2. Clone and Build

Now that yarn is set up, you can go ahead and clone this repository to a local directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LabKey/labkey-ui-components.git # or via ssh
```

Navigate into the packages/components directory and run:

```sh
yarn install
```

This will install all dependencies for the component packages.
Once this is complete you can utilize yarn to run builds for a package.


### Technologies
For doing development of LabKey UI Components, you should be familiar with the following technologies:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - used for building the UI components
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/) - for consistent, responsive styling
* [React-Bootstrap](https://5c507d49471426000887a6a7--react-bootstrap.netlify.com/) - bootstrap styling for react components
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) - for typing of javascript objects
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) - For unit testing of components
* [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - Testing utility library
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - For use in manual testing and exploration of features outside of an application

Note that we are currently not using the latest versions of Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap and Typescript because there
have been some significant changes between our current version and the latest version of these libraries, so when looking for docs,
be sure to look at the ones corresponding to the version we are using.

And, for building, we use
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - package manager and build tool

### Best Practices
You should do pretty well to follow the styles and practices currently represented in the code, but here are
some guides to best practices for doing front-end development:
* [Alan's Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hW9gYbWhW6spr7uhAjpKBNl3hWPXUOPbmlwD6UkYWE8/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g5627a1f538_0_120)
* [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

Generally, when doing development, you should:

* Place source code in a `src` subdirectory.
* Place typing files in a `src/typings` subdirectory.
* Add documentation a-plenty and update the package `README.md` release notes as you add/fix/update the package.

### Local Development

When making modifications to an existing package, you should:
* Update the version number for the package to be `X.Y.Z-fb-my-branch-name.0`, where `X.Y.Z` is your best guess at the
next [SemVer](https://semver.org/) version that will include your changes, `fb-my-branch-name` is the name of your
feature branch with underscores replaced by hyphens and the `.0` is just a starting point for the prerelease versioning.
You can do this editing manually within the `package.json` file or when running `yarn publish`.  See [below](#version-numbering) for
 more on version numbering.
* Update the `releaseNotes/labkey/components.md` file to document what is changing in this version.
* Write [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) tests together with [enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) to test
non-rendering functions and rendering of components with different sets of parameters.  Jest
tests should be preferred over other types of tests since they are quick to run and small enough to be easily understood,
but they should generally not try to do a lot of interaction with the components. You can, however, validate that callbacks
passed to a component are called when expected.  See existing `.spec.ts` files for examples.
* Write jest tests that use actual server responses where needed.  We have several examples of tests using `xhr-mock`
for reading in realistic data that can be captured from the server.
* Write or update [storybook stories](#storybook) that illustrate the functionality.  This is the easiest way to do the bulk of manual
testing and iteration on display updates.  Again, we have several examples of stories that use actual data captured
from the server for various Ajax calls that are required.
* Test within the application once display and functionality are as expected from within storybook.

#### Getting @labkey/components packages to the application

While you can [publish](#publishing) a pre-release version of the glass packages and then update your application's `package.json`
to reference the new pre-release version in order to view the changes within the application, you will likely want to
be able to do this without publishing for quicker development iteration.

In order to use and test the components you are developing or modifying in this repository within another application,
we currently recommend using `yarn watch` together with a copy command from the `dist` directory to the `node_modules/@labkey/components`
directory of your application. The `watch` command will automatically build a package when the source code changes.  If you have hot reloading started for your application, after you copy the `dist` directory, changes made in the components
will then get loaded into the application.

For example, for the querygrid package, you could do:
* ``yarn watch``
* edit files
* wait for recompile triggered by the `watch` to happen
* ``cp -r dist /path/to/my_app/node_modules/\@labkey/components``


We do not currently recommend using [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html) (or [`yarn link`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/)).  It seems promising,
but when used it produces an empty page in the application in many cases and the following type of error in the console:
```
react-dom.development.js:55 Uncaught Invariant Violation: Element ref was specified as a string (reactSelect) but no owner was set. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You may be adding a ref to a function component
2. You may be adding a ref to a component that was not created inside a component's render method
3. You have multiple copies of React loaded
```
I believe this happens because the `node_modules` directory within this directory contains all of the dependencies for the package,
including the ones that are excluded in our bundling of the package since they are also included by the application.
This includes, most notably, a copy of `react`.  When the application loads it will get one copy of react from this
`node_modules` and one copy from its own `node_modules` and unhappiness ensues.  There are probably things we can do to
fix this, but for now use watch and copy instead.

### Package Dependencies
We track our external dependencies in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W39yHLulzLUaXhp5-IRFuloJC9O94CJnwEHrR_4CcSo/edit#gid=0)
in order to maintain notes about the cost of updating our various packages.  To do package updates, use the
```
yarn outdated
```
command to show which packages are out of date and then compare to the spreadsheet to determine if there has already
been investigation into the cost of upgrading packages that are out of date.

### Documentation
We use [typedoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc) for generating our documentation.  This documentation is published to [GitHub pages](https://labkey.github.io/labkey-ui-components/).

All exported components, methods, interfaces, etc. should include
documentation.  You can use the supported [JavaDoc tags](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) to provide additional explanations for parameters, return values, etc. as well as for indicating that some objects should not have documentation generated for them.

You can generate the docs locally by running the following command in the ```labkey-ui-components``` directory.
* ``yarn run build:docs``

**N.B.** This command produces a good number of errors from Typescript not being able to resolve classes and such.
Try to eliminate as many of these as possible before deploying the docs.

To publish the documentation to [GitHub pages](https://labkey.github.io/labkey-ui-components/) use the following command in the ```labkey-ui-components``` directory:
* ``yarn run deploy:docs``

This deployment of docs should be done after each pull request is merged into ```master```.

### Storybook

A great way to view and play with these components is via [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). This is a tool that is used to deploy components in a functional environment which runs the components according to "stories".
These stories are composed by developers to show features of a component and let other members of the team interact with a component. Because storybook uses WebPack's hot reloading,
this is also a great way to do visual inspection and testing of your components in isolation.

For each component that is developed a set of stories that illustrate the components should also be created.  We follow these
conventions currently:
* The configuration files for storybook are in the `.storybook` directory.
* Stories are placed the directory `src/stories` with the names of the story files the same as the names of the respective components
* The [addon-knobs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-knobs) package is used for parameterizing the stories so a user can
explore the different options available within a component.

You can start up Storybook via:

```sh
yarn run storybook

# The storybook instance is now available at http://localhost:9001
```

When changes are made to the source code or .scss files for the components or the stories, the storybook instance will automatically reload.

### ESLint and Prettier
**In an effort to maintain consistent formatting, it is highly recommended to run lint-fix or lint-diff-fix on any files you've changed.**

ESLint / Prettier package scripts and configurations are included in this package. ESLint can be run on a file, directory or
all directories with the following commands.

```shell script
yarn run lint ./src/components/files/FileTree.tsx
yarn run lint ./src/components/files/*
yarn run lint ./src/components/**/*
```

ESLint can be run with the --fix flag, to automatically fix as many issues as possible, with the following command.

```shell script
yarn run lint-fix ./src/components/files/FileTree.tsx
```

To lint only the files you have changed there are two target scripts, lint-diff and lint-diff-fix. These will perform
a git diff and lint only the files that have local changes (precommit). By default these scripts will lint any changed
files in the src/ directory, but a parameter can be passed to them with a different file or directory path relative to the
labkey-ui-components/packages/components directory (eg. src/components/files).

```shell script
yarn run lint-diff-fix
yarn run lint-diff src/components/files
```

Prettier is an ESLint plugin with additional formatting rules. This is automatically run with ESLint in this package.

For more information on [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint) please refer to their online docs.

## Publishing

### Credentials
In order to publish, you will need to set up your npm credentials.  Follow [these instructions](https://internal.labkey.com/wiki/Handbook/Dev/page.view?name=npmrc) to create your .npmrc file.
If you do not have permissions to publish to this repository, contact a LabKey Artifactory administrator who can grant you those permissions.


### Version numbering

When updates are made to any @labkey npm package, the version number updates will follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
The next version you go to for a package should be based on the following guidelines:
1. Am I fixing a bug but not adding anything new - use the next patch version
1. Am I adding something new, but not changing anything that already existed - use the next minor version
1. Am I breaking something existing because of my changes - use the next major version

With that in mind, we want to make use of "prerelease" version numbers while a feature / story is being developed
and only go to that next “release” version right before the feature branch on labkey-ui-components is ready to
merge back to master.

Steps for package version numbering during feature branch development:
1. Create your feature branch off of master, i.e. fb_feature_1, and add your changes.
1. When you are ready to push an alpha version up to Artifactory so you can test it in your application and
on TeamCity, update the `package.json` version for that package. Ex. if adding a new feature and the current version is `0.1.0`,
you would use `0.2.0-fb-feature-1.1`.
1. If you make further edits to your feature branch and need to push new alpha versions, you would just bump the last
digit in your package version number (e.g., `0.2.0-fb-feature-1.2`, `0.2.0-fb-feature-1.3`, etc.).
1. Once your feature branch is complete and ready to merge, you do one more package version update to what will be the
"release" version (i.e. `0.2.0` in this scenario) and then build/publish and complete the merge. Don't forget to update
the release notes in your package's `README.md` file for this version number. And don't forget to update your application
package.json for this new version number (if that applies).
1. Once merged and the "release" version has been pushed to Artifactory, you can then go to Artifactory and delete your
alpha versions of that package for this feature branch.

## Publishing commands

From the package root (not the repository root!) of the package you want to update (e.g. `packages/components`) run:

```sh
yarn publish
```

This will prompt you for the new version.  Choose a version increment in accordance with [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  This command will
update the `package.json` file and commit that change.  Then you can do a `git push` to get the update into the remote repository. (Note,
you could instead use `npm publish`, but you will have to update the `package.json` file manually before using that command.)
